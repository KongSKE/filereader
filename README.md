# Input-Output Tasks
by Bill Gates
I ran the tasks on a Microsoft SurfaceBook with 2.4Ghz i5-7200U,
and got these results:
Task                                          | Time
----------------------------------------------|-------:
Read file 1-char at a time to String          | 1.8598 sec
Read file 1-char at a time to StringBuilder   | 0.0071 sec
Read file line at a time using BufferedReader | x.xxxx sec
## Explanation of Results
